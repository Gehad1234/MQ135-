##  Air Quality Monitor with ThingSpeak Integration
one of semicolon startup IOT projects (My startup)

### Description

This Arduino project is an air quality monitor that utilizes the MQ135 gas sensor to measure air quality and sends the data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform. The system is designed to be used in environments where monitoring air quality is important, such as indoor spaces.

### Components

- **MQ135 Gas Sensor**: The project uses an MQ135 gas sensor to measure air quality, particularly the concentration of certain gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3).

- **Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)**: The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is used to connect to Wi-Fi and send data to the ThingSpeak platform.

- **OLED Display**: An OLED display is used to visualize the air quality data.

### Setup

1. Connect the MQ135 gas sensor to the Arduino board:
   - Connect the sensor's analog output pin to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the sensor's power and ground pins to 5V and GND on the Arduino, respectively.

2. Connect the OLED display to the Arduino using I2C:
   - Connect the display's SDA pin to the SDA (data) pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the display's SCL pin to the SCL (clock) pin on the Arduino.

3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:
   - Adafruit GFX Library
   - Adafruit SSD1306 Library
   - MQ135 Library
   - ESP8266WiFi Library

4. Replace the placeholders in the code with your specific configuration:
   - `apiKey`: Replace it with your ThingSpeak Write API key.
   - `ssid`: Replace it with your Wi-Fi SSID.
   - `pass`: Replace it with your Wi-Fi password.

5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

### Usage

Once the project is set up and the Arduino is powered on, it will continuously read air quality measurements from the MQ135 gas sensor. The air quality data is then displayed on the OLED display and sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing you to monitor and analyze air quality data over time.

### ThingSpeak Configuration

Make sure you have set up a ThingSpeak channel with the appropriate fields to receive and display the air quality data. The channel should match the fields used in the code for data upload.

### Additional Note

- The code uses a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) between data updates to ThingSpeak, but ThingSpeak typically requires a minimum of 15 seconds between updates.
